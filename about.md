### Who am I?

Hi,there! Iâ€™m Henry Arbolaez a humble and cool guy! I love making stuff for the web and helping others. I attended Wyncode Academy coding bootcamp on Sept 24, 2015 and I am a also completely self-taught Front End Developer ([Freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/arbolaez001){:target="_blank"} & [Teamtreehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/henryarbolaez){:target="_blank"}) with a lot to learn and will continue this journey every day. I love front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript) of the application but sometimes I get my hand dirty on (Ruby on Rails, Nodejs, Expressjs and PHP).


I may not the smartest guy, but I am smart and I will get the job done because I'm always pushing myself to accomplish any goal. I want to learn and be part of an amazing Front End Development team and company..
